## üîç Step-by-Step Security Check

### 1. Check Your Accounts First
Before checking your phone, verify if your accounts have been compromised:

- Enter your email address and phone number
- See if your information appears in any data breaches
- **Action:** If compromised, change passwords immediately

### 2. Review Installed Apps
**For Android and iOS:**

4. Look for:
   - Apps you don't recognize
   - Apps with suspicious names
   - Duplicate system apps
   - Apps with excessive permissions

### 3. Check Battery Usage
**Android:**
- Settings > Battery > Battery Usage
- See which apps use the most power
- Look for unfamiliar apps high on the list

**iOS:**
- Settings > Battery
- Check battery usage by app
- Tap "Show Activity" to see background activity

### 4. Monitor Data Usage
**Android:**
